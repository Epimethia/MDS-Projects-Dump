1.1	TRIED TO MAKE RAND() A FUNCTION
1.2	THE FUNCTION WORKS, BUT THE VALUES CALLED ARE THE SAME. SUSPECTED TO BE BECAUSE OF DATA RACING. THE
	SRAND(TIME(NULL)) IS NEEDED TO SEED THE RAND() FUNCTION, HOWEVER IT DOES SO AT A RATE THAT IS NOT
	FAST ENOUGH TO CREATE UNIQUE VALUES WHEN FUNCTIONS ARE CALLED DIRECTLY AFTER ONE ANOTHER, SUCH AS
	SEEN IN LINES 68 TO 70.

		int randNums()
		{
			srand (time(NULL));
			int result;		//Local Variables
			result = rand() % 6 + 2;
			return result;
		}

1.3 ATTEMPTED TO USE A DIFFERENT METHOD TO SEED THE FUNCTION; HOWEVER SAME RESULT. NOT FAST ENOUGH.
1.4 Reverted back to original randomizing
		
		srand(time(NULL));
		rand()%6 +2;
		

2.1	Attempted to replace dowhile loop with a switch.
2.2 Ran into problems with non constant variables

3.1 Attempted to replace the title screeen with a function
3.2 first iteration did not work. was not changing the state of the game correctly, keeps thinking
	that i put an invalid character, even though it is valid.
	
	int title()
	{
		int iInput;
		cout << "Player's Chips: " << iChips << endl << endl;
		cout << "1) Play Slots" << endl;
		cout << "2) Quit Slot Machine" << endl;		
		cout << "3) Credits" << endl << endl;
		cin >> iInput;
		return(int(iInput));
	}

3.3	Corrected the problem. Apparently i was just being retarded, wasnt setting the returned value
	of title() as iInput, which was needed

4.1 The problem still runs with the everything. If any input other than a number, the program goes
	into an infinite loop.
