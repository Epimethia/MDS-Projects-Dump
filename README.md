# MDS Projects
 by James Devenport
A number of projects that I've done for my Bachelor of Software Engineering course at Media Design School. Some of them are complete, some of them are not.

## Complete Projects
---
#Matrix Project
Was a very simple matrix operation console application. Precursor to the Calculator project under `Broken Projects`.
---
### Plotter
A simple console program made to plot the outline of a circle in the console. Was one of my first programs that I wrote.
---
### Piroots of the Currybean
My first OpenGL 3D project. Was a game I made for all of my classes in one go. The game itself was for my 3D graphics(OpenGL) programming class. The enemies and the ship movement were implementations of [Autonomous Agents](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/). There was a networking component as well (we had to make the game multiplayer using WinSock2) but I was unable to complete it to a satisfactory standard in time. I was only able to implement a connection between a server and a client. Actual Gameplay was not achieved, sadly. I may come revisit this project one day, as I find it to be one of my proudest projects, even though it fell short of what it could be. 
NOTE: The game is playable. There is a .exe file under the Release folder. There is a problem where the player can go out of the map though! I managed to fix it in a more recent version but currently do not have the project on my home computer.

### Calculator Project
Was meant to be a WinAPI application that calculated Quaternions, Slerp, Matrix Operations (4x4) and Gaussian Elimination. One of my first WinAPI applications. Was especially proud of the determinant and inverse functionality. A lot of students in my class found a very long and arduous equation to calculate the determinant and inverse, that took a ridiculous amount of code to implement. I took a little longer than them, but I managed to make it work using a lot of `for()` loops and other things, working with the results I got from [this](https://matrix.reshish.com/determinant.php) calculator here.

### Multi-Threaded Loader
A very simple multithreaded application, made when we were learning about it. Used to load multiple images at the same time and display them/ load multiple sound files and play them. Was built around a framework provided by MDS. Want to come back and revisit one day, as I think multi-threading is a really cool concept and want to learn how to leverage it for future projects.
---
### Paint-Tool
A very basic paint clone made with WinAPI. Was made before I learnt the concept of backbuffer rendering, hence the really bad screen flickering. I have another version implemented with the backbuffer somewhere, will update and move to `Completed Projects` when I find it. Built around a framework provided by my teacher, Asma Shakil.

### Slot Machine
This I would consider my "first" actual programming project, I think. We were tasked to make a console coin slot machine. Was super accurate because you never won anything haha. This project I believe took 6 weeks to make, and at the end I was still strapped for time. I am proud of it though, as it was my first foray into coding. I recently started programming in Swift, and challenged myself to remake it in Swift. Did it in about 2 hours. Oh how far I've come from my humble beginnings.
---
### Space Invaders
A remake of the classic game in WinAPI, using my own assets. This was my first game-style project with a graphics API. I struggled a little at the start getting my head around how game processing should work. I eventually got it working, but I think I messed up using DeltaTime, among other things. I'm hoping I might be able to revisit this one, maybe in Swift, since that is what we're currently doing in class right now.

## Broken Projects

---
## Uncomplete Projects
---
### Tree Data Structures
Here, there were meant to be two projects in this one solution. One is here, the Binary tree with binary tree operations, but also a general tree. The entire class was very confused on what to do for the General tree, as the project brief that the lecturer gave us did not state that each node could have more than 2 children, and how the nodes were to determine when to make a new branch etc.
---
### Minimax Project
An implimentation of the minimax algorithmn in a tic-tac-toe game environment. Was actually completed, but current code is the only one I can find on my home computer. Will go digging for it if I can find time at school and move to `Completed Projects`
